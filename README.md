See multiple "Merry Christmas" greetings!
Most of them are animated. Unfortunately, I cannot animate pyfiglet (probably due to the fact that the render( ) renders multiple lines of print( )???).
When you run this program, you will be asked to input a version of "Merry Christmas". Currently, there are four versions.
Please enter "one", "two", "three" or "four" (currently, there are only four versions). 
View the results on your terminal.

*** UPDATE!!! ***

Got version 3 to animate, but it looks bad.
